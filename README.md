## Jet Fuel

Jet Fuel allows user to shorten a long URL and save it in a thematic folder. When user clicks on a shortened link, it redirects them to the original, long URL.
It is my first project in which I developed backend, using Node/Express with Knex and PostgreSQL databse.
Client-side code was written in jQuery.
Server-side is tested for all of the required endpoints, using mocha, chai and chai-http. The tests include both 'happy' and 'sad' paths.
